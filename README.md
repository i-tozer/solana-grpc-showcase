# Solana gRPC Showcase

A demonstration project showcasing the implementation of gRPC with Solana blockchain. This repository serves as a technical showcase of integrating modern API technologies with blockchain infrastructure.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a gRPC service layer on top of Solana blockchain, enabling efficient, type-safe, and bidirectional streaming communication for blockchain applications.

### What is gRPC?

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and horizontal scaling.

### What is Solana?

Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and marketplaces. It offers fast transaction speeds, low costs, and a growing ecosystem of applications.

## Features

- **Bidirectional Streaming**: Real-time updates from the Solana blockchain
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed interfaces using Protocol Buffers
- **High Performance**: Efficient binary serialization and HTTP/2 transport
- **Cross-Platform**: Client libraries available in multiple languages
- **Solana Integration**: Direct interaction with Solana blockchain

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16+
- Protocol Buffers compiler
- Solana CLI tools
- Node.js (for JavaScript client)
- Python 3.8+ (for Python client)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/i-tozer/solana-grpc-showcase.git
   cd solana-grpc-showcase
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install Go dependencies
   go mod download
   
   # Install JavaScript dependencies
   cd client/js
   npm install
   
   # Install Python dependencies
   cd client/python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Generate gRPC code from Protocol Buffers:
   ```bash
   protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. proto/*.proto
   ```

4. Start a local Solana test validator:
   ```bash
   solana-test-validator
   ```

5. Run the gRPC server:
   ```bash
   go run server/main.go
   ```

## Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Transaction Monitoring**: Stream transaction confirmations as they occur
- **Account State Subscriptions**: Receive updates when account data changes
- **Program Execution Monitoring**: Track program invocations and state changes
- **Cross-Language Client Support**: Interact with Solana from any language with gRPC support

## Technical Details

### Protocol Buffers

The project defines several Protocol Buffer message types for Solana entities:

- `Transaction`: Represents a Solana transaction
- `Account`: Represents a Solana account state
- `Block`: Represents a Solana block
- `Signature`: Represents a transaction signature

### gRPC Services

The following gRPC services are implemented:

- `TransactionService`: Submit and monitor transactions
- `AccountService`: Query and subscribe to account updates
- `BlockService`: Stream block information
- `ProgramService`: Interact with Solana programs

## Performance Considerations

- **Connection Pooling**: The server implements connection pooling for Solana RPC
- **Batching**: Requests are batched where appropriate to reduce RPC overhead
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached to reduce load on the Solana network
- **Backpressure Handling**: The server implements backpressure mechanisms to handle high load
